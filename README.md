# SampleWork
### created October 2016

 Here is short sample of work done by Jeremy Novak in the fall of 2016.  
 This work was done for a course on Computer Networks. The program _EmailSender_ can be run from the console by running the file _EmailSender.class_, the program takes in no arguments and sends an email to my email account using a java socket connection. The program can also be run from a standard development environment, by using the _EmailSender.java_ file, and exhibits the same behavior. The version of the program with implemeted GUI can be run by downloading the files and loading them into a standard development environment.
