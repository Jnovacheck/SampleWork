# SampleWork
### created October 2016

 Here is short sample of work done by Jeremy Novak in the fall of 2016.  
 This work was done for a course on Computer Networks. The program _EmailSender_ can be run from the console by running the file _EmailSender.class_, the program takes in no arguments and sends an email to my email account using a java socket connection. The program can also be run from a standard development environment, by using the _EmailSender.java_ file, and exhibits the same behavior. The version of the program with implemeted GUI can be run by downloading the files and loading them into a standard development environment.
 
 To find the name of your local mail server:
 1. Open a Terminal window
 2. Enter the command _nslookup -Type=mx YourWebsidteName_ 
   * Replace _YourWebsiteName_ with the name of a website with an internal mailserver, such as google.com
 3. Find the one of the mail exchangers, and copy one of the exchangers to use
 
 To use the Javadoc for the _guiEmailSender_ open the _doc_ folder and open the file _index.html_. You can then use a web browser to view the contenst of the Javadoc
